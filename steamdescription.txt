Adds Frackin' BYOS ships themed after the Elithian Races. You require both Frackin' Universe and Elithian Races for this mod to work, since FU adds the BYOS system and ERM adds the races, racial blocks and objects.

This mod does not add any races, and doesn't enable playing the Akkimari on the steam release of ERM, though you can choose any BYOS ship as any race.

You don't need to play an ERM race to use these ships, as with all BYOS templates they can be chosen by any species. You will need [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1194878261] this patch [/url][/b] to use the BYOS system with non-FU/vanilla races.

Q: 'How do I repair my FTL?'
A: With FU's BYOS system, you need to research and craft your own FTL drive in the Engineering tree. Speak to Esther at the Ark, she has a tutorial quest for FTL travel.

Q: 'Will you add ships for the other Elithian Races?'
A: If and when races subsequent to the Akkimari are released, most likely. The non-implemented races don't have blocks and objects (and I know very little about them), so I can't build ships for them.

Q: 'What about the Centens?'
A: They have tiles and objects, but I wouldn't want to make them freely available to the player until I see how ERM implements them as a playable race. They also lack the necessary ship components.

Q: 'How do I make my ship bigger?'
A: They're BYOS ships, build them as large as you wish. I recommend picking up the relevant racial crafting recipes at the Creon Embassy, Starfarer's Refuge and Trink settlements. For Akkimari blocks you'll have to raid their microdungeons, like a true scavenger.

Q: 'How do I get more Akkimari furniture?'
A: Wait for the Akkimari race to be officially released, or spawn it in.

Q: 'How do I get the controller for the Akkimari vehicle?'
A: Unchanged from ERM, the Chaseflight controller is a very rare drop from the vehicle-riding Akkimari found in their tower microdungeons.

Q: 'Can I replace my current BYOS with one of these?'
A: It's possible with /placedungeon, but I wouldn't recommend it. Pick up your BYOS components first if you try.

Q: 'Can I replace my non-BYOS ship with one of these?'
A: No, and you will break your shipworld if you try. The decision between BYOS and non-BYOS is a binary choice, and you can't go back on it.

Q: 'You should do one for X race.'
A: That's outside of the scope of this mod, which adds ships themed after the Elithian Races specifically.

Q: 'Is this safe to uninstall?'
A: Yes. Once the ship is placed, the mod's job is done. Uninstalling won't break your ship since I don't add any blocks or objects, they're all FU or ERM.

Q: 'Is this mod client-side?'
A: No. If you want to play with someone who doesn't have it, or use the ships on a server without this mod: Make your character, pick your ship, then uninstall this mod. Your ship will be fine. Alternatively, get them to install the mod as well.

[h1] Please help, I'm crashing! [/h1]

This mod is very lightweight. The only changes it makes to other files is patching the FU ships.config to allow you to choose the new ships. As a result, if you're having issues then your problems aren't caused by me. You most likely have:

1: Mods incompatible with Frackin' Universe. See [b][url=https://frackinuniverse.miraheze.org/wiki/Incompatible] this list [/url][/b].

2: Very old and outdated mods, which break everything they come into contact with. If a mod hasn't been updated since Starbound 1.4.4 came out (August 2019) it's probably at least somewhat broken, and mods that attempt to change how FU works (beyond compatibility patches) are usually outdated within a month or so.
